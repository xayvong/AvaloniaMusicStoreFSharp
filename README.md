# AvaloniaMusicStore with F# 

![AvaloniaMusicStore](https://github.com/xayvong/AvaloniaMusicStoreFSharp/assets/89797311/9c4a3ca7-5a17-4d97-839b-d78da8741c6f)

This is an MVVM project that uses Avalonia UI, F#, and ReactiveProperty. This will be a guide and an example of the Music Store App from from their tutorial, and the different ways I approached
and overcame some the difficulties I had during the process. 

I'm also still quite new to F# and Avalonia, so if anyone has any advice on what I could have differenlty or better (Or maybe explain how the heck I use ReactiveUI with F#), any suggestions are welcome!

You can check out the Avalonia here:

Here's the tutorial I followed:

And here is ReactiveProperty, which I used as an alternative to ReactiveUI and Community Toolkit:
